# World Forge

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-lilac.svg)](LICENSE)

A deterministic authoring-to-execution toolkit for typed multi-genre creation
projects, immutable generic gamepacks, reviewed/sealed assets, bounded runtime
adapters, and standalone games. The existing RPG worldpack and tested
2D/2.5D `isoworld` pyray/raylib runtime remain a backward-compatible reference
specialization. Runtime data works without an LLM, AI API, or Internet
connection; runtime AI is forbidden.

This repository contains **the Forge**, not a particular world or game. A
generic creation repository may describe a game, universe library, or asset
library without forcing lore, actors, narrative, or an RPG structure. Retained
world-authoring repositories keep their published legacy workflow. A separate
game repository owns executable code, UX, imported immutable artifacts,
platform CI, and releases. No game-specific lore is hardcoded here.

AI can assist **outside the game** with experience design, mechanics, typed
content, worldbuilding or narrative when applicable, presentation, and assets.
Its output is never accepted directly: GPT orchestrates, a human or authorized
lead reviews, `worldforge` validates, and deterministic compilation/sealing
creates runtime artifacts. Prompts, providers, models, credentials, and mutable
authoring source never enter a distributed game.

## Planned foundation: Harness, Studio, Engine Lines, and Tool Center

Slice 1 records architecture and vocabulary only; it does **not** add an agent
harness, Team Mode, Engine Lines, `gamepack_runtime` SDK/ABI changes, a Tool
Center, provider execution, discovery, installation, or a new UI. Existing
Studio, gamepack, worldpack, runtime, and game contracts remain unchanged.

Team Mode requires exactly three distinct model lineages; if they are
unavailable, it must show a visible degraded mode and cannot claim consensus.
The Forge-independent `gamepack_runtime` kernel already exists. Slice 5 plans
only its additive formal SDK/ABI role and evolution. Its target materialized
external-game layout is editable `src/engine/` and `src/game/`, an exact
`engine.lock.json`, and an immutable `src/isoworld/` snapshot where the legacy
snapshot applies; the current scaffold remains unchanged until that slice.
The pyray boundary applies only within editable `src/engine/`; immutable legacy
`src/isoworld/` retains its published compatibility imports.

The baseline is `8334f2536ee03f541cbee7f729379139e70241df`. GitHub Actions are
intentionally absent. Each future slice is governed by applicable local
verification and an independent fresh review. `hosted_evidence` remains
`PENDING` and native evidence remains `UNTESTED` unless exact real evidence
exists; a local result never becomes a hosted or native pass. Returning CI is
separate, explicitly authorized, time-boxed work.

The planned authority and vocabulary are recorded in
[ADR-0026](docs/decisions/0026-world-forge-agent-harness.md),
[ADR-0027](docs/decisions/0027-virtual-studio-governance.md),
[ADR-0028](docs/decisions/0028-project-owned-engine-lines.md), and
[ADR-0029](docs/decisions/0029-tool-center-capability-workflow-run-model.md).

## Architecture lanes

### Generic creation lane

`world-forge.project` v1 and its composable profile lead through typed modules,
phase-report v3 P00-P14, `world-forge.gamepack` v1, generic D1-D3 assets,
capability-based runtime resolution, readiness/handoff, and bounded standalone
materialization. `worldforge new-creation` defaults to the backward-compatible
neutral `universe_library`, and can explicitly create an `asset_library` or a
`game`. A game requires independent gameplay, world, narrative, presentation,
and runtime-support facets; no runtime adapter is inferred from gameplay or
fiction, so the initial scaffold is authoring input rather than executable or
release evidence. If a bound upstream identity changes,
`worldforge reconcile-creation` uses the previously captured workflow
status hash as a CAS and appends canonical invalidation/history before any
status, reopen, or completion transition.

### Legacy RPG lane

Published `rpg-world-forge.*` project/source/asset contracts,
`isoworld.worldpack` v1-v5, saves, replays, bundles, and the bounded
`isoworld_raylib_2_5d` adapter remain readable and behaviorally separate. They
are not renamed or widened into a generic union.
The visible identity is World Forge, while Python imports and the CLI remain
`worldforge`; the repository remote is not renamed, and app-ID migration remains
future-gated behind explicit hosted, backup, divergence, retry, rollback, and
native Windows evidence.

Authoring validity is not runtime executability. See the central
[`docs/MULTI_GENRE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/MULTI_GENRE_ARCHITECTURE.md) design
and exact [`docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md`](docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md) evidence levels
before interpreting a support claim.

## Current systemic slice (M5 complete)

- Canon-locked asset targets for 2D, 2.5D, or 3D, with approved visual/audio
  bibles, deterministic inventory derivation, and per-asset specifications.
- Hash-bound production requests and sanitized receipts for OpenAI Image,
  Blender MCP, and capability-discovered Modly extensions; GPT remains the
  orchestrator and provider tooling stays outside Forge and runtime code.
- Deterministic PNG canonicalization, atlas/clipset assembly, PCM WAV
  processing, strict TTF/OTF/GLSL validation, and recipe-bound receipt
  re-verification. Processing recipes remain v1; newly produced receipts are v2
  and bind the exact asset-root-relative recipe file, raw SHA-256, canonical
  content hash, inputs, operation, and output contract. Legacy v1 receipts
  remain identity-only readable.
- Provider-neutral GLB inspection and runtime-only `assetpack_v1` handoff for
  3D targets, plus a two-step build/hash-seal release lifecycle. The pyray
  reference runtime and current immutable game bundle remain explicitly
  2D/2.5D renderpack consumers.
- Thirteen bounded M5 skills covering OpenAI/Codex 2D/2.5D production,
  reference-led Blender modeling/rigging/animation/export, independent 3D QA,
  and fail-closed Modly operation/refinement.

The committed [`examples/m5-neutral`](examples/m5-neutral/) fixture is
**narrative-neutral**, local, procedural, and offline. Its schema-required
`openai` route value is a contract namespace; no provider, model, or network
call executes. The committed manifests are authoring-side `production`
evidence, not runtime packs. Readiness gates regenerate the fixture externally
and build/verify temporary renderpack and assetpack outputs, finalize copied
manifests, and validate their release profiles without committing those runtime
packs.

- Atomic v2 creation, inspection, cloning, explicit legacy upgrade, and
  optimistic-lock SemVer versioning for independent world repositories.
- Worldpack v5 with typed BCP47 localization, per-playable-actor campaigns,
  and pure runtime API/feature compatibility checks; v1-v4 remain loadable.
- Deterministic runtime-only bundles with complete hashes/licenses, portable
  paths, provider/authoring-metadata rejection, and stable SemVer releases.
- Atomic multi-world/multi-release game import under a runtime-neutral locked
  catalog, with rollback and verification of every existing release.
- Clean standalone game materialization with a locked `isoworld` snapshot,
  separate pyray platform lock, exact `raylib==6.0.1.0` baseline, independent
  verifier, native smoke, benchmark, deterministic package, and desktop CI.
- Canonical `game_data/shared.lock.json` for game-owned common presentation
  assets, including byte/media validation and a hash-bound notices contract.
- Forty-six Forge-only skills: nine bounded generic creation/gamepack/asset/
  runtime/handoff workflows plus retained one-operation legacy world, M5, and
  pyray specializations, with no all-in-one game-building skill.
- Enforced immutable seams: game extensions live under `src/game`; vendored
  runtime snapshots and imported bundles change only through dedicated Forge
  operations.

- Fixed-step game loop rendered through pyray.
- Isometric projection and semantic terrain (ground, water, and rock).
- Reactive state updates through actions and a deterministic reducer.
- Strict `WorldState -> immutable RenderState -> Renderer` separation.
- World-defined playable and non-playable actors; no hardcoded roster.
- Deterministic A* navigation, occupied-cell collision, and route reservations.
- Configurable world clock and schedules with ordered fallback destinations.
- Contextual interactions with flag/resource effects.
- Abilities with explicit resource costs, range, cooldowns, and effects.
- Versioned, worldpack-bound saves and deterministic action replays.
- Finite Tiled JSON and embedded LDtk JSON map import.
- Typed facts, rumors, secrets, and enforced per-actor knowledge boundaries.
- Directed relationship dimensions and per-actor faction reputation.
- Conditional dialogue graphs with fact-gated speakers and choices.
- Event-reactive quest stages and prioritized time-windowed scenes.
- Construction blueprints with footprints, costs, build time, dynamic collision,
  render bindings, and narrative events.
- Typed resources, located stockpiles, bounded capacity, production recipes,
  delayed outputs, and derived scarcity.
- Per-actor needs with deterministic decay and hierarchical, prioritized goals
  that can travel, consume, build, or produce.
- Persisted delayed consequences that react to domain events and form bounded,
  authored multi-stage arcs.
- Offline narrative reachability, producer, and softlock analysis.
- Offline content compiler and cross-reference validator.
- Offline asset pipeline with provenance and license tracking.
- Target-scoped asset manifest v3 with hash-bound specifications, complete
  receipt lineage, multi-file processed outputs, semantic bindings, and strict
  OpenAI/optional-Modly generation routes.
- Runtime-only hashed renderpacks compiled without prompts, model data,
  workflows, credentials, or production evidence.
- Pyray resource registry for textures, clipsets, fonts, shaders, SFX, and
  streamed music with deterministic cleanup.
- Texture-backed isometric tiles/actors, tick-based animation, depth layers,
  portraits, event audio, and zoom/pan camera with primitive fallbacks.
- A 15-phase workflow with GPT as lead agent and verifiable quality gates.
- Runtime audit that rejects AI SDK imports.
- Headless tests that do not open a window.

The included foundation pack is a **neutral technical vertical slice**. Real
worlds live in independent world-authoring repositories and can define
different actors, genres, rules, maps, languages, and campaigns without
changing the Forge. Independent game repositories import only immutable,
hash-locked releases.

## Current M6 slice (partial)

**PARTIAL — local implementation evidence only. Self-contained Studio release
remains blocked; a push alone cannot create hosted or native evidence. Those
states remain `PENDING`/`UNTESTED` until a separately authorized real
hosted/native evidence process exists and passes.**

The canonical generic release-lineage command is
`python -m scripts.verify_multigenre_release --native off --report <external>`.
On a supported v1 headless host (Linux x86_64 or Windows x86_64 with CPython
3.11/3.12), it exercises both executable multi-genre fixtures through
deterministic compile, real PNG/TTF processing and QA, sealing,
runtime/materialization, standalone verification, headless save/replay, package
reproducibility, and extraction. `off` truthfully records native execution as
untested. ARM64 hosts can run lower-level logic/unit checks, but cannot mint v1
headless/release evidence or publish a passed deterministic release report.
GitHub Actions are intentionally absent at the Slice 1 baseline. Existing hosted
evidence remains **PENDING**; local results and workflow definitions are
not hosted or native evidence. Returning CI requires separately authorized,
time-boxed work. The authoritative machine-readable status is
`docs/evidence/multigenre-release-status.json`.

The executable end-to-end fixtures are `abstract-puzzle` and
`branching-narrative`; hosted native evidence for the exact reviewed revision
is still pending. Four additional cases—`action-framing`, `faction-strategy`,
`modular-roguelite`, and `sports-career`—prove authoring breadth only. Each has
an exact authored gamepack and 16-file real asset production/QA lineage, but its
ledger remains `authoring_only` / `adapter_not_evaluated`; adapter execution,
packaging, and release are unproved and blocked. Across all six asset-bearing
cases the D2 fixture census is 96 files. A `release_ready` manifest is not a
sealed assetpack or a released game. The separate `systemic-simulation` case
has assets `not_applicable` while runtime is requested, so runtime remains
blocked rather than receiving placeholder assets.

- Forge Studio provides interactive World/lore, Assets, and Game cockpits over
  one durable local service. Source proposals remain exact reviewed changesets;
  neither Codex nor a provider can approve or apply them.
- Generic Studio editing and fixed controls for compile, asset process/seal,
  PNG/WAV preview, runtime compose/bundle, materialization bundle/standalone,
  package, extraction, and headless evidence publication are implemented and
  locally tested. Protocol v5 keeps exactly 18 transport methods; job/worker
  reaches v12, output grants reach persisted v6, and previews remain published
  v1 plus QA-candidate v2. Historical v3 create rejects `asset_content_mode`;
  v5 create accepts `asset_content_mode` so asset content mode and runtime
  support intent are orthogonal. The v5 handshake exposes only the four activated
  authority capabilities: `asset_authority_reviews`,
  `asset_release_authority`, `runtime_headless_authority`, and
  `creation_preview_pre_release`. This is not hosted, packaged-shell, native,
  or release evidence.
- Machine-readable capability, presentation, adapter, composition, and
  compatibility contracts support 2D, 2.5D, 3D, and mixed world-plane plans.
  Static adapter resolution and immutable composed bundles never turn contract
  data into an executable locator.
- Generic gamepack assets now traverse reviewed planning and production into
  closed deterministic processing, retained-byte QA, and a
  `world-forge.asset_manifest` v1 state of `produced`, `processed`, or
  `release_ready`. The single `validate-generic-asset-contract` command and
  Studio validator dispatch all fourteen authoring formats. D3 then seals only
  an exact `release_ready` lineage into a separate `world-forge.assetpack` v1
  runtime directory. Its integral verifier binds the canonical manifest,
  processed payloads, public notices, exact byte/media constraints, and nested
  inventory to one immutable hash. A sealed pack is still not runtime
  compatibility, adapter execution, bundle composition, or release evidence.
- Generic puzzle and branching-narrative bundles can now be exercised through
  canonical `world-forge.game_execution_script` v1 scenarios. The
  Forge-independent headless kernel proves deterministic transitions plus
  save/restore/replay continuity, then publishes an external immutable
  `world-forge.headless_evidence_set` v1. This remains non-native evidence:
  `native_execution` is false, Studio inspection delegates semantics to its
  packaged Python runtime, and release stays blocked.
- The exact same runtime bundles can now be opened by bounded
  `gamepack_raylib_2d_puzzle@1.1.0` and
  `gamepack_raylib_2d_text@1.1.0` implementations. A fixed 60 Hz controller,
  semantic keyboard/pointer input, exact sealed PNG/TTF loading, and a
  deterministic recording backend prove local render behavior without
  importing the Forge. The narrative adapter renders only compiled authored
  English text with the sealed font; the puzzle adapter adds shape, number, and
  text feedback rather than relying on color alone.
- Generated standalone games can install and independently verify composed
  releases, then run representation-neutral headless, save, replay, package,
  extraction, and extracted-package workflows without `worldforge`.
- Native-verified presentation is still limited to the exact legacy Linux
  x86_64 2.5D adapter. The new bounded 2D adapters isolate their lazy `pyray`
  import behind the backend and fail closed on undeclared hosts, but fake
  backend tests are not native evidence. The pyray GLB proof deliberately lacks
  collision and remains
  incompatible with every current 3D/mixed profile; it is not a playable 3D
  runtime or representative performance evidence.
- Exact Studio runtime provenance, secure acquisition, deterministic synthetic
  assembly, and shell-package verification are implemented. Verified
  `shell_only` packages exclude Python and Codex, retain all seven open
  legal/provenance blockers, and state `release_ready=false`.

### Deterministic standalone package boundary

`world-forge.game_package` v1 is the immutable transport for one already
materialized generic standalone game. `package-game` publishes a canonical
ZIP_STORED archive without replacement, and `verify-game-package` checks the
archive metadata, manifest, complete byte inventory, standalone lock, and
lineage before any extraction write. `extract-game-package` then publishes an
exact verified tree through an identity-bound Linux/Windows journal.
`recover-game-package-extraction` resumes only the recorded immutable tree;
`rollback-game-package-extraction` removes only a proven unpublished stage.
Ambiguous ownership or changed hashes fail closed and preserve evidence.

The Forge transaction never executes game-local `scripts/verify_game.py`.
That script is a separate post-extraction check run from a disposable game
context without Forge mutation authority. Package integrity, extraction,
headless execution, and replay evidence are independent: the resulting game
still reports `release: blocked` while hosted native evidence is absent.

The full evidence, exclusions, and remaining gates are recorded in
[AUDIT_M6_2026-07-24.md](docs/AUDIT_M6_2026-07-24.md). Self-contained artifact
publication, signing, and runtime-download CI are intentionally absent; see
[ADR-0021](docs/decisions/0021-studio-runtime-distribution-boundary.md).

## Forge Studio application service

Forge Studio v1 begins with a local, provider-free Python application service.
It preserves the separate Forge, world-authoring, bundle, and game repository
roots while giving a future desktop client one strict interface for durable
workspace registration, events, job state, and explicitly approved source
changesets. It does not run models, providers, Blender, Modly, watchers, or the
graphical game runtime. Its only executable jobs are offline receipt validation,
world-anchored assetpack verification, deterministic headless runtime ticks,
and deterministic replay verification.

Start the service with an explicit user-data directory outside every project:

```bash
worldforge-studio-service --data-dir /path/to/user-data/rpg-world-forge-studio
```

The process reads and writes one strict UTF-8 JSON object per line on standard
input/output. Public v1 request methods are `service.initialize`,
`workspace.register/list/get/overview`, `source.list/read`,
`asset.catalog.list/inspect`, `asset.preview.open/read/close`,
`world.validate/analyze`, `events.list`,
`changeset.create/get/list`, `changeset.diff/approve/reject/apply`, and
`job.create/get/list/transition/cancel`.
Contract errors are returned as correlated `error` envelopes; a malformed line
does not terminate the stream.

`job.create` is a closed operation-specific contract that writes managed v2 job
records. Paths are portable and relative to the registered world
(`asset.receipt.validate` is relative to `world_root/assets`), and
`runtime.headless` accepts integer ticks from 0 through 1,000,000. Previously
stored v1 jobs remain readable, recoverable, listable, and cancelable, but are
never claimed or retried. A single durable FIFO scheduler runs eligible v2 jobs
in a fixed isolated worker; no job can select an executable, module, working
directory, root, argument vector, or environment. `job.cancel` records durable
intent, and a running managed job becomes canceled only after its process tree
has been terminated and reaped.

The read-only authoring methods expose only manifest-declared world source
documents. They return portable paths and hashes from bounded, pinned reads;
never absolute repository paths. Validation and narrative analysis reuse the
existing Forge domain logic entirely in memory and do not publish reports.
The Electron preload exposes these reads and the four offline jobs only as
named capabilities. Its two asset catalog methods bind pagination and
inspection to an exact manifest revision; Electron main owns the 64-entry page
limit, protocol methods, operation names, request IDs, and timeouts. Renderer
input cannot supply catalog paths, media types, categories, cursors, binary
payloads, or arbitrary parameters. Three separate preview methods authorize
only manifest-selected PNG/WAV entries and sequential 64 KiB chunks. Their
arguments contain only revision/entry identity or an opaque handle/sequence;
Electron main validates stream correlations, strips canonical protocol base64,
and returns fresh `Uint8Array` bytes through the named preload boundary. No
preview UI is introduced by this service boundary.
The World cockpit groups those authorized sources, keeps drafts only in memory,
checks JSON syntax, and renders bounded neutral map previews on Canvas. A dirty,
syntax-valid draft can be explicitly staged as one exact base-hashed replacement
for human review; it is never autosaved or written directly. The cockpit opens
the returned immutable v2 text and JSON Pointer diff, requires separate approve
and apply confirmations, and refreshes verified sources only after apply
succeeds. Legacy v1 records remain readable with exact diff unavailable; the
desktop does not offer fresh v1 approval or apply. The World, Assets, and Game
cockpits share a responsive accessible keyboard tablist; inactive panels remain
mounted so an in-memory World draft survives discipline changes.
The read-only Assets cockpit lazily loads one revision snapshot, replaces pages
under exact revision-bound next/previous controls, filters categories only
within the current page, and displays bounded JSON/GLSL or verified
PNG/WAV/font/GLB metadata. Authorized PNG/WAV entries may use the bounded
revision-bound preview lease; no arbitrary file access or 3D rendering is
introduced.
The Game cockpit exposes exactly three existing fixed jobs: engine-neutral
assetpack metadata/handoff verification, reference-runtime headless simulation
for 0 through 1,000,000 ticks without graphics, and verification of an existing
replay action log. Its paths are blank, portable, and relative to the selected
workspace. The result view accepts only valid v2 records for that workspace,
shows structured inputs, state, timestamps, results, and observed progress, and
never displays raw payloads, worker output, or repository roots. The bounded
job view is not chronological. It does not record replays, use generated-game
slots, launch a game, create a bundle/package, or claim an M6 3D runtime.

Changesets edit only UTF-8 files beneath a registered world's `source/`
directory. New v2 records retain the exact base and proposed snapshots in
content-addressed storage under the external data directory and bind their
ordered operation descriptors with `review_sha256`. Exact bounded text hunks,
with a strict-JSON Pointer supplement when applicable, are derived only from
those retained bytes. A v2 approve, reject, or apply must echo the reviewed
hash. Apply durably claims `applying` before any repository mutation, rechecks
every base hash and filesystem identity under the world lifecycle lock, and
uses a review-bound journal so an interrupted multi-file apply is completed or
rolled back without claiming cross-filesystem atomicity. Existing v1 records
remain actionable but report that exact base review bytes were not retained.

The public contracts are
[`forge-workspace`](schemas/forge-workspace.schema.json),
[`studio-protocol`](schemas/studio-protocol.schema.json),
[`studio-changeset`](schemas/studio-changeset.schema.json), and
[`studio-job`](schemas/studio-job.schema.json). The application boundary is
recorded in [ADR-0011](docs/decisions/0011-forge-studio-application-service.md),
with immutable review evidence and apply claiming specified by
[ADR-0015](docs/decisions/0015-studio-reviewable-changesets.md).

The desktop shell lives in [`apps/studio`](apps/studio). It is a sandboxed
Electron client that loads only `rwf-studio://app`, exposes named typed preload
operations, and supervises both the Python service and an optional exact Codex
0.144.6 app-server without a shell or `PATH` fallback. Codex is bound to one
registered workspace and can only stage or inspect changesets through the
three-tool Forge MCP boundary; approval and apply remain human-controlled.
Development requires explicit `WORLD_FORGE_STUDIO_DEV_PYTHON` and
`WORLD_FORGE_STUDIO_DEV_CODEX` executables. Deprecated `RWF_STUDIO_*` aliases
remain accepted only when their values do not conflict with canonical names;
unequal dual values fail closed.
Native packaged runtimes and the broader
visual authoring tools remain separate release slices. The current package
workflow builds and statically verifies only an external `shell_only` tree with
Python and Codex absent. The self-contained path is fail-closed by the checked-in
runtime provenance contract and cannot publish while its seven blockers remain
open; see
[ADR-0012](docs/decisions/0012-forge-studio-desktop-shell.md) and
[ADR-0013](docs/decisions/0013-workspace-bound-codex-bridge.md), plus the
distribution decision in
[ADR-0021](docs/decisions/0021-studio-runtime-distribution-boundary.md).

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
python -m pip install -e ".[game]"
worldforge validate examples/foundation/source/manifest.json --profile release
worldforge compile examples/foundation/source/manifest.json \
  --output content/compiled/foundation.worldpack.json
isoworld --pack content/compiled/foundation.worldpack.json
```

Without installing the package:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m worldforge validate \
  examples/foundation/source/manifest.json --profile release
PYTHONPATH=src python -m isoworld \
  --pack content/compiled/foundation.worldpack.json
```

Vertical-slice controls:

- Arrow keys or WASD: move one cell.
- Left click: plan an A* route to a cell.
- `Tab`: select the next playable actor defined by the worldpack.
- `E`: use the nearest available contextual interaction.
- `1`: use the active actor's first ability.
- `Q`: start the nearest eligible dialogue; number keys select a choice.
- `Esc`: leave a dialogue when its current node allows it.
- `Space`: dismiss an active scene.
- `F5`/`F9`: write/load the path supplied with `--save`.
- `Esc`: exit.

Save a run and record a replay:

```bash
isoworld --pack content/compiled/foundation.worldpack.json \
  --save saves/quick.json \
  --save-on-exit saves/latest.json \
  --record-replay saves/latest.replay.json

isoworld --pack content/compiled/foundation.worldpack.json \
  --replay saves/latest.replay.json
```

Saves and replays are tied to the exact world content hash. A changed worldpack
is rejected instead of silently loading incompatible state.

M3 exposes `build`, `start_production`, and `transfer_resource` as typed
`GameAction` values. A derived game supplies its own build/economy UI and
dispatches those actions; the forge runtime deliberately does not impose a
genre-specific construction menu. Completed or in-progress constructions are
visible in the pyray renderer, with `construction:<blueprint_id>` renderpack
bindings and primitive fallbacks.

## Create an independent world

The scaffold asks for only the decisions required to create a safe draft. It
does not invent lore or characters:

```bash
worldforge new-world ../my-world \
  --id my_world \
  --title "My World" \
  --language en \
  --version 0.1.0

worldforge world-status ../my-world
worldforge phase-status ../my-world
worldforge validate ../my-world/source/manifest.json --profile draft
```

`../my-world` is an independent **world-authoring repository**, not a game
repository. It includes `AGENTS.md`, 15 ordered phases, decision and task logs,
multi-agent claims, phase reports, narrative source directories, and an
asset-production workspace. GPT can run the entire process as lead agent;
specialist roles are optional.

World identity and lineage operations are explicit:

```bash
worldforge clone-world ../my-world ../another-world \
  --id another_world --title "Another World" --version 0.1.0
worldforge bump-world-version ../my-world \
  --expected-version 0.1.0 --part minor \
  --reason "Add a reviewed campaign" --approved-by lead-agent
```

New world projects use the retained `rpg-world-forge.project` discriminator at
format version 3 with `tool_repository="world-forge"`. Existing version 2
projects remain readable without mutation. Migrate one explicitly by hashing
the exact current `.worldforge/project.json` bytes, reviewing a side-effect-free
dry run, and then applying the same compare-and-swap source hash:

```bash
worldforge migrate-world-project ../legacy-world \
  --expected-source-hash <sha256-of-exact-project-json-bytes> --mode dry-run
worldforge migrate-world-project ../legacy-world \
  --expected-source-hash <same-sha256> --mode apply
```

A clean dry-run also reports `apply_supported` and an exact
`apply_capability_reason` without creating a lock or migration artifact. If a
durable migration record is already present, dry-run validates its immutable
backup and journal boundary and reports recovery required instead of claiming
fresh-apply readiness. Linux uses an identity-checked `RENAME_EXCHANGE`
transaction. Windows apply is bounded to build 20348 or newer and a
capability-proven local NTFS volume: retained 128-bit file identities and
no-delete ancestry handles seal the source, a durable hard link retains its
original identity, and `FileRenameInfoEx` publishes the target with
commit-forward recovery. Windows never simulates rollback after an ambiguous
rename; unsupported or indeterminate states fail closed and preserve evidence.

Legacy format version 1 remains a separate explicit `upgrade-world` to version
2 operation. Ordinary loads never upgrade or migrate a project.

After the canon is complete:

```bash
worldforge compile ../my-world/source/manifest.json \
  --output ../my-world/build/my_world.worldpack.json
worldforge analyze-narrative ../my-world/source/manifest.json \
  --output ../my-world/build/narrative-analysis.json \
  --fail-on warning
worldforge init-assets ../my-world/build/my_world.worldpack.json \
  --target-dimension 2_5d \
  --output ../my-world/assets/manifest.json

# Optional and fail-closed: add only after reviewing the installed Modly stack.
# Omit this flag to keep the local route and executor disabled.
worldforge init-assets ../my-world/build/my_world.worldpack.json \
  --target-dimension 3d --enable-modly \
  --output ../my-world/assets-3d/manifest.json

# After authoring and approving target-bound visual/audio bibles:
worldforge validate-asset-bibles \
  --target ../my-world/assets/target.json \
  --visual ../my-world/assets/bibles/visual.json \
  --audio ../my-world/assets/bibles/audio.json
worldforge derive-asset-inventory \
  ../my-world/build/my_world.worldpack.json \
  --target ../my-world/assets/target.json \
  --visual-bible ../my-world/assets/bibles/visual.json \
  --audio-bible ../my-world/assets/bibles/audio.json \
  --output ../my-world/assets/inventory/assets.json

# Execute one reviewed recipe, then re-verify its exact recipe and outputs.
worldforge process-asset ../my-world/assets/recipes/portrait.json \
  --asset-root ../my-world/assets \

# After every required asset has complete production, processing, license, and

```

For a 3D target, replace `build-renderpack` with `build-assetpack` and write
`../my-world/assets/release/assetpack.json`; verify it with
`worldforge verify-assetpack`, then use the same `finalize-asset-release` and
release-validation steps. The assetpack is an engine-neutral implementation
handoff. The current `isoworld` reference runtime, `export-bundle`, and generated
standalone game consume only the 2D/2.5D renderpack path; a 3D game must add and
validate its own runtime adapter before importing the assetpack. This milestone
boundary is defined by
[ADR-0010](docs/decisions/0010-m5-asset-production-and-m6-3d-runtime-boundary.md).
The closed assetpack contains no license or authoring metadata. Required runtime
licenses and notices travel beside it as separately verified immutable-handoff
material.

The current 2D/2.5D production handoff becomes an immutable runtime bundle.
Forge-side tooling verifies and copies that bundle into a separate game
repository. It never copies the world's `AGENTS.md`, `.worldforge/`, editable
`source/`, production manifests, prompts, candidates, or model/provider
metadata.

```bash
worldforge export-bundle \
  ../my-world/build/my_world.worldpack.json \
  ../my-world/assets/release/renderpack.json \
  ../releases/my_world-1.0.0 \
  --release-id 1.0.0 \
  --licenses ../my-world/assets/release/licenses

worldforge verify-bundle ../releases/my_world-1.0.0 \
  --expected-hash <bundle-sha256>

worldforge new-game ../my-game \
  --id my_game --title "My Game" --source-revision <forge-commit>
worldforge import-bundle ../releases/my_world-1.0.0 ../my-game \
  --expected-hash <bundle-sha256>
worldforge audit-game ../my-game
```

Generic gamepacks use the separate, additive pre-execution bundle contract:

```bash
worldforge build-game-runtime-bundle \
  ../project/artifacts/game.gamepack.json \
  ../project/assets/inventory.json \
  ../project/assets/release/assetpack \
  --snapshot ../runtime/snapshot.json \
  --registry ../runtime/registry.json \
  --composition ../project/runtime/composition.json \
  --support-report ../project/runtime/support-report.json \
  --output ../releases/game-runtime-bundle

worldforge verify-game-runtime-bundle \

  --expected-hash <bundle-content-hash>

  --platform-lock ../runtime/platform-locks/<windows-cp312-lock-id>.json \
  --output ../releases/game-materialization-bundle

worldforge verify-game-materialization-bundle \
  ../releases/game-materialization-bundle \
  --expected-hash <materialization-bundle-content-hash>

worldforge verify-game-save \
  ../user-data/saves/<game-id>/<bundle-id>/slot.json \
  --bundle ../releases/game-runtime-bundle

worldforge verify-game-replay \
  ../user-data/replays/<game-id>/<bundle-id>/run.json \
  --bundle ../releases/game-runtime-bundle

worldforge verify-persistence-generation \
  ../user-data/saves/<game-id>/<bundle-id>/slot.slot/v1/generations/<sequence>-<hash>.json \
  --bundle ../releases/game-runtime-bundle
```

Bundle success proves exact transfer integrity only. Additive
`world-forge.game_save` v1 and `world-forge.game_replay` v1 documents bind the
exact gamepack, runtime composition, runtime bundle, neutral runtime API, and
execution-semantics hash. Saves contain only the declared saved-state
projection; restore reconstructs transient state from the immutable initial
state. Replays contain accepted actions only and verify every pre-state,
post-state, event, trace, final-state, and classification hash.
`world-forge.persistence_generation` v1 stores either unchanged payload in an
append-only, content-addressed DAG. Logical slot writes stage outside the
authoritative generation inventory, publish with native no-replace semantics,
fsync the retained directory, and never replace history. Concurrent sibling
tips fail closed until an explicit all-tip resolution; rollback appends a
previously verified payload. Legacy `<slot>.json` files remain read-only
compatible and require explicit hash-anchored migration before appending.

Studio validates their structure in JavaScript but routes semantic verification
to packaged Python; it does not implement gameplay semantics. The bundle and
checked-in support reports still deliberately report `pre_execution`,
`release: blocked`, and `supported: false`. Standalone-game materialization and
deterministic packaging are implemented, but neither is native execution or
hosted platform evidence.

The additive materialization envelope closes implementation identity only. It
binds the unchanged runtime bundle to exact code-owned package projections,
semantic entry points, and the four audited `raylib==6.0.1.0` CPython
3.11/3.12 Linux/Windows x86-64 wheels. A policy-only envelope reports
`contract_only` and `materialization_ready=false`; the ready state reports
`materialization_ready: true`, embeds the exact launcher/verifier inventory, and
may create an external standalone game repository. Neither state installs a
wheel or provides native-platform evidence.

The game is a normal standalone project. It contains no agent files or
authoring control plane and verifies/runs without `worldforge` installed.

## Import a map

The M1 importer supports finite, uncompressed Tiled JSON tile layers and
embedded LDtk IntGrid/tile layers. Create a reviewed numeric-to-semantic tile
mapping first:

```json
{
  "0": "ground",
  "1": "ground",
  "2": "rock",
  "3": "water"
}
```

```bash
worldforge import-map references/garden.json \
  --format auto \
  --id garden \
  --display-name "Garden" \
  --mapping references/garden.tiles.json \
  --layer Ground \
  --output source/maps/garden.json
```

The output records source and mapping hashes. Imported terrain remains source
data and must pass `worldforge validate`; manual overrides take precedence.

## Verification

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
PYTHONPATH=src python -m worldforge audit-contracts --source-root .
PYTHONPATH=src python -m worldforge audit-runtime src/isoworld
PYTHONPATH=src python -m worldforge audit-game /path/to/materialized-game
PYTHONPATH=src python -m scripts.verify_m5_release
```

The complete M5 release-readiness command requires a clean source tree and uses
only disposable directories outside the repository. It regenerates and closes
the narrative-neutral renderpack/assetpack paths, exercises offline standalone
bundle/replay/package behavior, builds reproducible wheel and sdist artifacts,
and audits clean isolated installs. Exact dependency versions are pinned, but
the requirement files do not provide hashes for every dependency and are not
described as fully hash-locked. GitHub Actions are intentionally absent at the
Slice 1 baseline. Hosted Ubuntu/Windows evidence remains `PENDING` until
separately authorized CI work produces exact real evidence.

### Agent Harness contract foundation

Slice 1B.1 additively advances the historical Slice 1A Harness plan with public
v1 `AgentWorkerActivation` and `AgentCapabilityGrant` closed canonical JSON
lineage documents. They intentionally provide no worker, provider, execution,
Studio, replay, or runtime capability. See [ADR-0030](docs/decisions/0030-agent-harness-contract-foundation.md).
